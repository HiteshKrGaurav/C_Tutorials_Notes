/* FILE I/O IN C */

WHY DO WE NEED A FILE?

> Files are used to store data and information
> Files are used to read & access data anytime from the hard disk
> Files make it easy for a programmer to access and store content without losing it on program termination

VOLATILE VS NON-VOLATILE MEMORY

        Volatile Memory (RAM)                                     Non-Volatile Memory (HARD DISK)

> Volatile memory is computer storagethat only            > Non-Volatile memory is computer memory that can
  maintains its data while the device is powered.           retain the stored information even when not
                                                           powered.

> The RAM will hold data, programs and information        > This type of memry is alo reffered as
  as long as it has a constant power supply but             permanent memory since data stored within it can
  immediately the power is interrupted all that             be retrieved even when there is no constant power
  content is cleared.                                       supply.

> The volatile memory will only hold data temporarily.    > It is used for the long term storage of data.

WHY DO WE NEED FILES?

> When a C program is terminated, the data stored in ram is lost.
> Storing in a file will preserve our data even sfter the program terminates.
> RAM is not able to handle quite large amount of data due to its small size relative to the hard disk.
> It is easy to transfer data as files.

TYPES OF FILES

> There are two types of files:
   > Text files
   > Binary files

/*

FILE OPERATIONS IN C

> In  C we can perform these high level operations on files:
    1. Creating a new file
    2. Opening a file
    3. Closing a file
    4. Reading from and writing to a file
