// In a typical c program there are ->
//      1. Pre-proccessor Command
//      2. Functions
//      3. Variables
//      4. Statements
//      5. Expressions
//      6. Comments

//  Here #include <stdio.h> is Pre-proccessor Command
//  Here int main() is a special type of function from where the program starts.
//  Here int is integer which is returned by the function main() Which goes to the OS
//  semi-colon (;) is used to end the statememt here semi-colon ends the printf
//  Here "return 0" gives 0 to the OS which means All Is Well
